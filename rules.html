            <h1>King of the Hill Football Pool: Official Rules</h1>
            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>A “King of the Hill” (KOH) style football pool is best when there are more
                people, so thank you for playing this year! To minimize the potential for any
                confusion to arise, we have created a definitive rule sheet. It is designed to be as
                short as possible and only include what is necessary. Before joining the pool,
                please read through the entire thing. If you have any questions after joining the
                pool, there’s a good chance this sheet answers them. If not, feel free to reach out
                for clarification.</p>
            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>The “King of the Hill” model entails elimination. Each week, you will choose a
                different NFL team (no repeats). If that team wins, you advance. If that team does
                not win, you are out. Last man (or woman) standing wins the pot.</p>
            <h2>Accessing the Pool</h2>
            <p>Everything you need is on this pool website. The website is currently hosted on my Github page,
                 but note that this may change from season to season. I'd recommend bookmarking it or saving it in some way.</p>
            <h2>Entering the Pool</h2>
            <p> You must do two things to be officially entered into the pool: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill out the form on the "join" section of the website</li>
                <li>Pay up before the start of your week one pick's game</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After you submit the join form, you will be directed to a page with payment instructions. You can access
                 the same page by clicking a link directly.</p>
            <p>Note the maximum of two entries per person. This is because we want the pool to be fun and relatively 
                equal - not a "pay to win" environment. We are very strict about this. Please don't use the name of 
                your pet, your deceased relative, your newborn son, or your friend who couldn't care less about football. You get the idea. </p>
            <p>A form submission with one or more valid picks accompanied by the correct payment before kickoff of the relevant game(s) will be considered a valid entry into the pool.</p>
            <h2>Payment and Winner's Pot</h2>
            <p>I want to be very clear about this: exactly 100% of the entry money goes straight to the winner's pot. 
                I am only holding onto the money. I don't take any cut.</p>
            <h2>Making Your Pick</h2>
            <p>Starting with week two, you will be able to make your pick with the "pick" form.
                The following rules apply with <span style="text-decoration:underline">no exceptions:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A pick MUST be time stamped before the relevant game for it to be valid</li>
                <li>A pick CAN’T be a repeat, or else it is invalid</li>
                <li>The most recent valid pick received will override all previous picks for which the game has not started</li>
                
                <li>If you have two picks, you can either submit the form twice, or submit it once with both picks, or any combination. If you only make one pick, both your picks will be for that team, unless you have already chosen it, in which case the entry that already chose it will be eliminated.</li>
                <li>A pick for a team on bye is not a winning pick</li>
                <li>A pick for a team that ties is not a winning pick</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rules are there to make sure that there are no questions as to the integrity of
                the pool.</p>
            <h2>FormSubmit </h2>
            <p>For convenience, we are using FormSubmit for the backend of the Join and 
                Pick forms. FormSubmit has been known to be buggy from time to 
                time. If the submission is taking a very long time to process, FormSubmit gives 
                you a server error, or you are othersise unsure if your entry/pick has
            been processed, please text or email us to confirm. We would hate to see someone eliminated 
            because of a silly technology issue. Text/email are valid methods to join and make picks.</p>
            <h2>Changing Your Pick</h2>
            <p>Week One: Resubmit the "join" form</p>
            <p>After: Resubmit the "pick" form</p>
            <p>As described above, later picks override earlier ones.</p>
            <h2>Winning</h2>
            <p>You have won the King of the Hill pool if everybody else is eliminated and you are
                still standing. At the end of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regular season</span>, if there are multiple players left,
                they are all winners, and accordingly, they will split the pot equally.</p>
            <h2>Good Luck!!!</h2>
